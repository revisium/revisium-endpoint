**Status: Experimental and Not Production-Ready**

Revisium is a tool (UI/API) inspired by JSON (JSON Schema) and Git, designed to provide a flexible and low-level headless CMS solution. **This project originated from a closed-source repository** where it was developed over the course of a year and a half as a proof of concept. I am now making it open source to foster community involvement, transparency, and collaborative improvement.
