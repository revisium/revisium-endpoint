**Status: Experimental and Not Production-Ready**

Revisium is a data platform inspired by JSON Schema and Git, designed to provide flexible API endpoints for structured data management. **This project originated from a closed-source repository** where it was developed over the course of a year and a half as a proof of concept. I am now making it open source to foster community involvement, transparency, and collaborative improvement.

## Use Cases

Revisium serves as a versatile data platform that can be configured for various scenarios:

- **Headless CMS** - Build content management systems with auto-generated GraphQL/REST APIs from your schema definitions
- **Source of Truth** - Centralize configuration data, business rules, and reference data with version control and branching
- **Configuration Management** - Store and manage application settings, feature flags, and environment-specific configurations
- **Data Prototyping** - Rapidly prototype data structures and APIs without backend development
- **Content Hub** - Manage structured content across multiple applications and channels
- **API Gateway** - Transform JSON schemas into production-ready APIs with built-in validation and caching
